/**
 * Constructs a histogram of local binary patterns (LBP) for each pixel.
 * 
 * For each pixel a histogram of LBP is constructed from all pixels in the region
 * specified by {@link #setNeighborhoodSize(int)}. In this region the LBP is
 * calculated for every pixel. The LBP is calculated by comparing the pixel
 * intensities of the central pixel to <tt>N</tt> neighboring pixels ({@link #setNumPoints(int)})
 * on a circle of radius <tt>r</tt> ({@link #setRadius(double)}). Interpolation
 * is used to retrieve the intensity of neighboring pixels.
 * 
 * The first two features represent the x and y coordinates of the pixel, the
 * remaining features the histogram of local binary patterns
 * (see {@link #setNumberOfHistogramBins(int)}).
 * 
 * In comparison to {@link MeanIntensityLocalBinaryPatterns}, this class computes
 * one histogram of each pixel and computes local binary patterns from neighbors
 * lying on a circle around the central pixel.
